-&lt;b>NOTICE:&lt;/b> To add/remove screens press MENU/Edit&lt;br>&lt;br>
-&lt;b>NOTICE:&lt;/b> To enable ORIENTATION, disable PERSISTENCE.&lt;br>&lt;br>
-&lt;b>REMEMBER:&lt;/b> You can hide apps from the drawer by using the custom catalogs (press menu key while the drawer is open) &lt;br>&lt;br>

&lt;b>Version 1.2.0:&lt;/b>&lt;br>
&lt;b>--------------&lt;/b>&lt;br>
-New option to show app drawer catalog navigation buttons when opening the app drawer &lt;br>
-New global notification system to show \"unread counters\" on app icons. Currently other app developers must support it, like Touiteur does. &lt;br>
-New functionality to dinamically resize already added widgets on the screen. Just longpress a widget and leave it on the original place. &lt;br>
-Added compatibility with Motorola\'s Motoblur resizable widgets &lt;br>
-Added custom Launcher Actions to the custom shortcuts. Now you can create shortcuts to launcher actions like opening the app drawer, showing the previews, etc &lt;br>
-Support for unlimited custom app catalogs (previously limited to 4) &lt;br>
-Inverted the app catalogs logic: Now new apps are not shown on all catalogs (sorry, you\'ll need to create your catalogs again) &lt;br>
-Minor fixes and improvements here and there... &lt;br>
